Aim: Have a set of rules that will improve useability of my code

THOUGHTS
Important to have a consistent format:
-IMPORT MODULES
--put first to show what is needed
-GLOBAL VARIABLES
--first section to make code more flexible and useable in the future
-DEFINING FUNCTIONS
--functions need to be defined early to avoid calling a function before it exists
-RUNNING CODE
--should be last as everything needs to be defined before called/run
'''


'''DEFINING FUNCTIONS'''
# Add comment before function to explain its aim
# This function should lay out general format for my functions
def explanation(a):
    a = "Name different from actual input or global variables"
